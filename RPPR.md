# Research Design
There has been a fundamental shift that recognizes both the interdisciplinary, team-based approach to science as well as the more fine-grained characterization and contextualization of the hundreds and thousands of contributions of varying types and intensities that are necessary to move science forward. Unfortunately, little infrastructure exists to identify, aggregate, present, and (ultimately) assess the impact of these contributions. These significant problems are technical as well as social and require an approach that assimilates cultural and social aspects of these problems in an open and community-driven manner. Here we approach these issues from a variety of perspectives - technical and cultural. Ongoing efforts include the development of a contribution role ontology (built on CRedIT through the CRedIT ontology) to support modeling of the multiple additional ways in which the translational workforce contributes to research; better understanding of the types of research objects generated; and mining of acknowledgements section of publications to harvest existing contributor roles to understand the current state and serve as “ground truth”. The acknowledgements work can also help demonstrate that the population of the ontology with actual data is successful to drive additional development. All work is carried out in a collaborative, open, and friendly manner - with an eye toward making credit and attribution easier for everyone.

# Methodology
The Architecting Attribution team runs a version of the Agile methodology. Agile is most often associated with software development, but this method of planning work incrementally, paired with continuous feedback, integration, and testing is conducive to the forward progress of this project.  We run bi-weekly sprints, with daily stand-ups where team members can call out blockers and dependencies. Similar to software development this team breaks work into user stories. 

This team has two integral members who are allocated at a small percentage to this project. The Agile framework allows the team to maximize productivity and collaboration to meet its goal. Piecing out what is a very large task into management chunks has seen our progress accelerate. Previously the team had operated on a more traditional waterfall methodology. This was not as effective as blockers were mainly discussed at Core meetings with little time for resolution. Team members lost valuable time with these waits. As work was not portioned out, it was not always clear what needed to be tackled first or upon what other people, decisions, or processes progress was dependent. 

# Expected Outcomes
- Contribution Role Ontology
- Digital research object taxonomy
- Annotation file format
- Attribution workflow for research information systems
- Local guide to support attribution in CTS at the hub level
- Demonstrator for the individual (boilerplate text generator based on CRO for a DOI)

# Timeline (monthly)
- 4/1/19 enhanced contribution role ontology
- 5/1/19 finalize strategy for digital object types
- 6/1/19 finalize annotation file format
- 9/1/19 demonstrator for the individual (boilerplate text generator based on CRO for a DOI)
- 10/1/19 Credit, Attribution, and Incentives workshop
- 3/1/20 implementation of data models into external workflows to pilot and gather data.

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
**Demonstration project.** We don’t have a clear picture of the demonstration project development process or responsible party. We’re developing a person-based process for identifying contributor roles, based on the Northwestern Promotion and Tenure documentation, specifically the critical references form, in partnership with the Office of Faculty Affairs, as a guide to faculty members to better identify and claim contributor roles for research objects. This work will allow us to demonstrate the value and power of the data models.
