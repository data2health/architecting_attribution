# Architecting Attribution

## Problem statement
It is very difficult to know who is contributing to translational science. This project will allow the tracking and attribution of our diverse and non-traditional translational workforce to support greater knowledge of what skills and activities are needed, and to incentivize participation.

## Project description
There has been a fundamental shift that recognizes both the interdisciplinary, team-based approach to science as well as the more fine-grained characterization and contextualization of the hundreds and thousands of contributions of varying types and intensities that are necessary to move science forward.  Unfortunately, little infrastructure exists to identify, aggregate, present, and (ultimately) assess the impact of these contributions. These significant problems are technical as well as social and require an approach that assimilates cultural and social aspects of these problems in an open and community-driven manner. Here we are developing a contribution role ontology to support modeling of the multiple additional ways in which the translational workforce contributes to research.  This effort also includes mining of acknowledgements section of publications to harvest existing contributor roles to serve as “ground truth” and demonstrate that the population of the ontology with actual data is successful and drives additional development.

## Alignment to program objectives
This work helps to support and enhance a collaborative informatics community by fostering and promoting the development of an academic attribution and reimbursement framework for informatics products and processes. These processes could facilitate  the contribution to be used for academic promotion and recognition.
