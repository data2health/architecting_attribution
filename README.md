# Architecting Attribution

## Problem statement
*From template - needs to be updated:* Please include a Project Statement on your landing page. Your problem statement should be in the form of: What can CTSAs/the community not do now, that would be addressed by this project's success? A problem statement should be a clear vision and the overall method that will be used to solve the problem at hand. 

## Project description
There has been a fundamental shift that recognizes both the interdisciplinary, team-based approach to science as well as the more fine-grained characterization and contextualization of the hundreds and thousands of contributions of varying types and intensities that are necessary to move science forward.  Unfortunately, little infrastructure exists to identify, aggregate, present, and (ultimately) assess the impact of these contributions. These significant problems are technical as well as social and require an approach that assimilates cultural and social aspects of these problems in an open and community-driven manner. Here we are developing a contribution role ontology to support modeling of the multiple additional ways in which the translational workforce contributes to research.  This effort also includes mining of acknowledgements section of publications to harvest existing contributor roles to serve as “ground truth” and demonstrate that the population of the ontology with actual data is successful and drives additional development.

## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.
