## Problem statement
It is very difficult to know who is contributing to research and what those contributions are. This project enabled the tracking and attribution of diverse contributions across the workforce to support credit for work, better understanding of what skills and activities are needed, and to incentivize participation.

## Project description
There has been a fundamental shift to recognize both the interdisciplinary, team-based approach to science as well as the hundreds and thousands of more fine-grained contributions of varying types and intensities that are necessary to move science forward.  Unfortunately, little infrastructure exists to identify, aggregate, present, and (ultimately) assess the impact of these contributions. These significant problems are technical as well as social and require an approach that assimilates cultural and social aspects of these problems in an open and community-driven manner. Ongoing efforts include  the development of a [contribution role ontology](https://github.com/data2health/contributor-role-ontology) (built on CRedIT through the [CRedIT ontology](https://github.com/data2health/credit-ontology)) to support modeling of the significant ways in which the translational workforce contributes to research; better understanding of the types of research objects generated; and mining of acknowledgements section of publications to harvest existing contributor roles to serve as a data source to drive additional development. All work was carried out in a collaborative, open, and friendly manner with an eye toward making credit and attribution easier for everyone.

## Alignment to program objectives
This work helps to support and enhance a collaborative informatics community by fostering and promoting the development of an academic attribution and reimbursement framework for informatics products and processes. These processes could facilitate  the contribution to be used for academic promotion and recognition.

## Deliverables
- An increased knowledge base of contribution / attribution data available
  - [CRedIT Ontology](https://github.com/data2health/credit-ontology)
  - [Contributor Role Ontology (CRO)](https://github.com/data2health/contributor-role-ontology) released & enhanced and ready to pilot in research information systems
    - CRO is available in various ontological resources (Bioportal, Ontobee)
    - CRO is available in multiple formats (OWL, OBO)
  - A [summary statement](https://contributor-attribution-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) describing the components of the architecting attribution project (e.g. the [CRO](https://github.com/data2health/contributor-role-ontology), the a[nnotation file format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sqDi2RtErDUqP1ovyV45Cz07vYvxnpyOjwBVJt2k3a8/edit#gid=0), etc.) and how they interoperate.
  - [Best practices for attribution and use of attribution](https://reusable-data-best-practices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/chapter_8.html) are documented in the Reusable Data Guidebook (RDG) to support attribution in CTS at the local level 
  - A [Critical Reference Annotation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10s3nScM4nrL1G00JvuhGTkREEc9mX4_KL0yVP_ZyWP4/edit)
  - [Draft Contribution Model Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jMISwIFNj38AUfNZZbT_Osq7vrkmqZYsJ4ubmqEbOa8/edit)
- Attribution workshop [Attribution F2F notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14usojjGshNBCXQ6oEtIFbpV3nGWmhWm_6KD1kOkIV7Q/edit) and community building via [abstracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pd8VUrvOGzFNEDsO0PkAdRSWrMisu6cW0) and [presentations](https://digitalhub.northwestern.edu/collections/b0375b45-0b95-4bf8-9ee7-7df4d6fb47e4))
