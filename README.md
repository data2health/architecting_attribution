# Architecting Attribution 

## Problem statement
It is very difficult to know who is contributing to translational science. This project will allow the tracking and attribution of our diverse and non-traditional translational workforce to support greater knowledge of what skills and activities are needed, and to incentivize participation.

## Project description
There has been a fundamental shift that recognizes both the interdisciplinary, team-based approach to science as well as the more fine-grained characterization and contextualization of the hundreds and thousands of contributions of varying types and intensities that are necessary to move science forward.  Unfortunately, little infrastructure exists to identify, aggregate, present, and (ultimately) assess the impact of these contributions. These significant problems are technical as well as social and require an approach that assimilates cultural and social aspects of these problems in an open and community-driven manner. Here we approach these issues from a variety of perspectives - technical and cultural. Ongoing efforts include  the development of a [contribution role ontology](https://github.com/data2health/contributor-role-ontology) (built on CRedIT through the [CRedIT ontology](https://github.com/data2health/credit-ontology)) to support modeling of the multiple additional ways in which the translational workforce contributes to research; better understanding of the types of research objects generated; and mining of acknowledgements section of publications to harvest existing contributor roles to understand the current state and serve as “ground truth”. The acknowledgements work can also help demonstrate that the population of the ontology with actual data is successful to drive additional development. All work is carried out in a collaborative, open, and friendly manner - with an eye toward making credit and attribution easier for everyone.

## Alignment to program objectives
This work helps to support and enhance a collaborative informatics community by fostering and promoting the development of an academic attribution and reimbursement framework for informatics products and processes. These processes could facilitate  the contribution to be used for academic promotion and recognition.
