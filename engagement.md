 * [Feedback and brainstorming](https://github.com/data2health/architecting_attribution/issues/42). What else can we be doing with this project? Where would you like to see us focus? What do you want to help create? 

 If you don’t see exactly what you want to be doing, please know that as we progress in the project our needs will change. 

If you are interested in participating, and haven’t done so yet, please onboard
