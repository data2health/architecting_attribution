# Engagement Plan

We are looking for community participation in the following areas:
A number of hubs, particularly those actively developing and/or enhancing the semantics of research profiling systems and those active in team science, will likely be interested in
- driving requirements regarding key concepts to be discovered (e.g., model organisms),
- contributing extraction rules to the acknowledgements engine, and
- consuming the resulting data for incorporation into their local environments.

# Attribution workshop

Dates are being finalized for a community workshop in Chicago in the late spring in 2019. Check back for more information.
